# Heztro's PC Optimizer

Hey there! 👋 This is an optimization tool that I've been working on. I made this because I'm annoyed of having to either do all of these tweaks manually or having to pay money to use Windows optimizers (Hone.gg, Vtrl.cc, etc.) This replicates their functionality completely, with a better FPS boost - since our program is a simple batch file.

## What's This All About?

This is a powerful Windows optimization tool that I created to help boost system performance. While it works great right after a fresh Windows install (that's actually the ideal time to use it), you can run it anytime to get better performance. It's especially good at removing Microsoft's bloatware and optimizing your system for maximum FPS in games.

## The Features

### Performance Optimizations
- 🚀 **Ultimate Performance Mode** - Unlocks Windows' hidden performance mode
- 🎮 **Game Mode Enhancements** - Optimizes your system specifically for gaming
- 💻 **Process Optimization** - Smart CPU priority management for better performance
- 🔧 **Registry Tweaks** - Deep system optimizations through registry modifications
- 📊 **Memory Management** - Intelligent RAM and page file optimization

### System Cleanup
- 🧹 **Deep Cleaning** - Gets rid of temporary files, old updates, and system junk
- 🗑️ **Bloatware Removal** - Removes pre-installed Windows apps you don't need
- 🔄 **Windows Update Management** - Control over what gets updated and when
- 💾 **Disk Optimization** - Defrag for HDDs and TRIM for SSDs

### Gaming Optimizations
- 🎯 **Input Lag Reduction** - Minimizes input lag for better gaming response
- 🖥️ **NVIDIA/AMD Optimizations** - GPU-specific tweaks for better performance
- 🎥 **Game DVR Control** - Disable resource-hungry recording features
- 🕹️ **DirectX Optimization** - Enhances DirectX performance

### Network Optimizations
- 🌐 **Network Tweaks** - Reduces latency and optimizes connection speed
- 🔒 **DNS Optimization** - Faster and more secure DNS settings
- 📡 **TCP/IP Optimization** - Better internet performance
- 🚦 **Network Monitoring** - Real-time network performance tracking

### Privacy & Security
- 🛡️ **Telemetry Control** - Manage what data Windows collects
- 🕵️ **Privacy Settings** - Enhanced privacy configurations
- 🚫 **Tracking Prevention** - Blocks known tracking domains
- 🔐 **Windows Defender Management** - Security optimization without performance impact

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11 (fully tested on both)
- Admin rights (needed for system modifications)
- NVIDIA GPU (AMD GPUs work, but there are no specific tweaks for them.)

## Getting Started

1. Download the latest release
2. Run `heztrotweaker.bat`
3. That's it! No complicated setup needed.

## Using the Tool

Just launch the program and you'll see different sections for various optimizations. I've made it pretty straightforward:

1. Pick the optimizations you want
2. Click apply
3. Restart your PC when prompted
4. Your PC is now faster!

## Fair Warning ⚠️

While I've tested this extensively, some optimizations make deep system changes. It's always smart to:
- Create a system restore point first (the tool can do this for you)
- Read the descriptions before applying optimizations
- If something doesn't feel right, you can always use the restore feature
